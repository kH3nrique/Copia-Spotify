						We were speeding together
						Down the dark avenues
						But besides of the stardom
						All we got was blues
						But through all of that sorrow
						We were riding high
						And the truth of the matter is
						I never let you go, let you go
						We were scanning the cities
						Rocking to pay the dues
						But besides of the glamour
						All we got was bruised
						But through all of that sorrow
						We were riding high
						And the truth of the matter is
						I never let you go, let you go
						You go down just like Holy Mary
						Mary on a, Mary on a cross
						Not just another Bloody Mary
						Mary on a, Mary on a cross
						If you choose to run away with me
						I will tickle you internally
						And I see nothing wrong with that
						We were searching for reasons
						To play by the rules
						But we quickly found
						It was just for fools
						Now through all of this sorrow
						We'll be riding high
						And the truth of the matter is
						I never let you go, let you go
						You go down just like Holy Mary
						Mary on a, Mary on a cross
						Not just another Bloody Mary
						Mary on a, Mary on a
						You go down just like Holy Mary
						Mary on a, Mary on a cross
						Your beauty never ever scared me
						Mary on a, Mary on a cross
						If you choose to run away with me
						I will tickle you internally
						And I see nothing wrong with that
						Nothing wrong with that
						(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
						Nothing wrong with that
						(Mary on a, Mary on a cross)
						(Mary on a) Mary on a cross
