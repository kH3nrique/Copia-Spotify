                    I am not the only traveler
                    Who has not repaid his debt
                    I've been searching for a trail to follow again
                    Take me back to the night we met
                    And then I can tell myself
                    What the hell I'm supposed to do
                    And then I can tell myself
                    Not to ride along with you
                    I had all and then most of you
                    Some and now none of you
                    Take me back to the night we met
                    I don't know what I'm supposed to do
                    Haunted by the ghost of you
                    Oh, take me back to the night we met
                    When the night was full of terrors
                    And your eyes were filled with tears
                    When you had not touched me yet
                    Oh, take me back to the night we met
                    I had all and then most of you
                    Some and now none of you
                    Take me back to the night we met
                    I don't know what I'm supposed to do
                    Haunted by the ghost of you
                    Take me back to the night we met
                </p>
